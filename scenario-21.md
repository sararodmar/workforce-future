# And now we're burnt.

As the projections established years ago, global climate changed, heat-trapping gas emissions continued to grow, very heavy precipitations caused major floods
and huricanes became stronger and more intense, destroying many cities. Droughts and heat waves reducing soil moisture, impeding agricultural productions and increasing wildfires. Insect outbreaks and tree diseases caused widespread tree and crop die-off. 

The pollution in the air and water has decreased their quality. Now drinking water is scarce and people have to wear masks everywhere. 

Sea level rising up to 4 feet only added to aforementioned floods; animals (including humans) have been forced to relocate to livable areas REF NASA [#](https://sararodrig.github.io/workforce-future/references). 

Thank you, next.
