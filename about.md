# Motivation for this project

During the past few months I have found myself often in conversations about the future, especially the future of work and our relationship with machines. Some were very catastrophical (machines taking all jobs and mass unemployment, AI turning into the Terminator, etc.), others, contrarily, with extremely positive views, but that didn't consider any ethical or negative implications. Both seemed too polarized. As an educator, I like to keep up to date to the questions I receive, and I know I will not (and should not) always have a response for every question, but I thought of this project as an opportunity to at least get a glimpse of what was out there regarding this topic, and hopefully provide stronger and more accurate arguments in my future conversations. 

This video game is the multimedia portion of the Final Research Project for LAI 515: Science, Technology and Human Values. For an in-depth review of the findings described in this game, please see *The Future of the Workforce: A literature Review*. I chose to develop this video game firstly, because I thought it paired quite well with my findings (especially with the fact that coding and computer software engineering jobs are only going to increase in the next few years), and because I like video games in general, but also because I wanted to include some satire into the views about the future of the workforce and our society. I don't agree with the idea of gamifying everything (although I'm a fan of Habitica!), but some say it's what's to come: [here is an example](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34592186).

All content in this game has been extracted from my findings during my literature review and discussions with experts, as well as my own experiences. Given the time and space constrains, only a selection of topics (by no other criteria than my own) have been selected to be part of this project; I am aware that this research could have included a lot more content or other directions. 

Some of the scenarios are purposefully dramatic and catastrophic. It is my highest hope that the "witty" or "funny" tone throghout the game comes as just that, funny, and foremost that nobody feels offended by it.

# Contact me!

Given how much fun it has been to develop this, I am planning on expanding it (time permitting) beyond this project and class, so please contact me if you have any ideas or recommendations at: sararodr@buffalo.edu. I look forward to your feedback!
