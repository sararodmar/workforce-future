# Title

Your CHRO has read the World Economic Forum reports and tells you that reskilling or upskilling (6 to 12-month trainings to develop technical skills, such as programming and technology design, and personal skills such as creativity and leadership) is the way to go. Together, you devise a tree plan to upskill the trainers in your company, that will train other workers in turn, making it even more efficient. Who do you train?

1. [Well, only the workers that already have leadership positions and the younger ones make sense. Older people tend to be too slow in this world.](./scenario-11)
2. [As many as possible! With the plan we've devise we should be able to do it pretty fast.](./scenario-13)
3. [Well, that sounds like a lot of money. What about all the other investments and problems I have?](./scenario-14)
