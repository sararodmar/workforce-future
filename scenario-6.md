# Your end is near.

You lay off 150 million "obsolete" workers from your company. Other (much wiser) countries hire your talent like crazy and keep on growing. Unfortunately, because the company is the same as the country your (ex-)workers live in, they may no longer be getting a salary from you but they are quite likely to stay. Without salaries, they cannot pay for food or housing. Poverty and homelessness rates skyrocket, there are strikes and mobs everywhere, a civil war on your hands. 

Your company's shares and power plummet. Because no one has money, ex-workers cannot provide you with revenue, and with so much money invested in military to control the mobs, you no longer make profits. You declare bankrupcy, other companies buy you out and divide you into pieces. You are no longer the supreme leader (and you're actually probably in another company's jail).
