# Training for all!

Reports support that companies are increasingly recognizing that technologies work best when they complement humans, instead of replacing them. 

There is also a growing recognition that AI tools, for example, require human oversight, by watching, training and improving algorithms. 

Also, the implementation of new technologies is not limited to purely technological endeavors. As an example, Morgan Stanley, equipped 16,000 financial advisers "with machine learning algorithms that automated rote tasks, freeing up advisers to focus on client service"[1](https://sararodrig.github.io/workforce-future/references).
