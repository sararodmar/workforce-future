# Nice!

Reports support that companies are increasingly recognizing that technologies work best when they complement humans, instead of replacing them. There is also a growing recognition that AI tools, for example, require human oversight, by watching, training and improving algorithms. And the implementation of new technologies is not limited to purely technological endeavors. As an example, Morgan Stanley, equipped 16,000 financial advisers "with machine learning algorithms that automated rote tasks, freeing up advisers to focus on client service". (REF. MIT Review) [#](https://sararodrig.github.io/workforce-future/references)

In addition to reskilling, other proactive strategies by organizations are the development of new paths, new roles and changes in the workplace to accommodate all workers, even those in their 50s-70s. As an example of the latter strategy, BMW increased production by 7% in just three months by providing cushioned floors and adjustable work benches to an assembly line staffed with older workers. 


That being said, age discrimination is already becoming a main-stream diversity issue and liability concern: during 2016, there were over 21,000 age discrimination complaints filed with the US Equal Employment Commission.
