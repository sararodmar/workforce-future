# You like companies so much...

You allow them to take over the world: countries are no longer countries, but very very large companies (put snowcrash reference?)[#](https://sararodrig.github.io/workforce-future/references). 

You are now CEO of United States of America by Google and run all operations in this newly expanded company. Your team of advisors tell you your engineers have devised a way through Artificial Intelligence (AI) to increase productivity by 50%. 

They can have this new system up and running in about 6 months. "Unfortunately", a lot of your existing jobs are going to become obsolete. What do you do with your workers?

1. [In the next 7 months, I lay off the majority of my workforce. They are no longer my problem.](./scenario-6)
2. [I will speak with my Chief of Human Resources, maybe we can find ways to relocate them?](./scenario-7)
3. [Hm, I'm a CEO now but I was also a worker once. Even back then the long schedules we have now seemed unproductive. Over the years I've devised a schedule decrease without changing the salary. I've always wanted to put it into practice...](./scenario-8)
4. [Wait, wait. What about the implications of using AI?](./scenario-9)
