# Progress delayed 

You looove the past; so much you stay in it. As supreme leader, you halt all scientific research and even lead some demonstrations, where you destroy computers and robots with weaving frames (you have a sense of humor). 

As all fields involving technology paralize (medicine, research, work), people get sick, hunger and poverty skyrocket as you cannot handle production for so many people. A group of insurrectionists reach your chambers. They want to hang you (also Luddite style) [16](https://sararodrig.github.io/workforce-future/references).
