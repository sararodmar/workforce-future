# Is this the real life?

Your world is now formed by employer-free workers and cooperatives that are controlled by all its members in comunion, some decide to work on climate change, a topic they tell you is so important it could end the world as you know it. Several others decide to work on AI, but do so ethically, first by adding checks and balances to every part of the process, and by reskilling their employers. Then, little by little, by forging robust wellfare states (all the taxes you get are invested in pensions, healthcare and general wellbeing for everyone): poverty, hunger and homelessness are part of the past. 

Now, nobody has to work if they don't want to, humans live in perfect harmony with machines, as well as the Earth (so many efforts were put into banning fossil fuels and the use of renewable energies that you solved it), and they dedicate their life to traveling to and learning about other cultures, to the arts (such as painting, dance, literature)...

[... then you wake up.](./start)
