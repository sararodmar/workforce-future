# Good choice!

You have gone on holidays to Costa Rica on many ocasions and are close friends with Carlos Alvarado (its president). You have heard about his plans to stop the use of fossil fuels by 2021 (REF CR article)[#](https://sararodrig.github.io/workforce-future/references). Together you devise a plan to invest in renewable energies. 

You ban fossil fuels worldwide and enforce companies to adopt new models of conducting their business without worsening climate change. You (and the world) will live!
