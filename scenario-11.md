# The future catches up fast.

Doing this might seem like a good idea in the beginning, the younger workers and leaders will adapt seamlessly. Unfortunately, having to send so many people into early retirement depleats your pension funds and now you have to start taking it away directly from your revenue and profits. Also, seeing the value that older workers have (such as many more years of expertise, in-depth knowledge of the field), other companies hire these workers like crazy and either create new positions for them (such as mentors or coachers) or adapt their work systems for them. BMW for example, for very little money were able to increase productivity by 7% in 3 months, only by cushioning the floors and providing adjustable benches to assembly lines staffed with older workers (REFERENCE MIT REVIEW).
