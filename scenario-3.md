# There are options!

Cooperatives are increasingly becoming popular, as well as freelancing and remote working. Freelancing especifically is becoming more and more popular, especially in the growing world of IT to fill "skill gaps" [20](https://sararodrig.github.io/workforce-future/references). By hiring wholly new employees such as external contractors and temporary staff that possess the skills you need. 

You also take a look at AirBnB's "employer-free" model, where workers bring in their skills (or assets, in the AirBnB case, their homes), they can set their own rates and time schedules. The "employer" only needs to set up the platform for the exchange of goods or services to happen and usually gets a fee out of each payment.  

1. [That sounds really good, but if they are not permanent staff... Who pays for their benefits?](./scenario-15)
2. [Awesome, plus now I don't have to pay for benefits!](./scenario-16)
3. [The remote working also sounds pretty neat.](./scenario-10)
