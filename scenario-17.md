In addition to coops, there are other options that are increasingly becoming more popular, such as freelancing and remote working. Freelancing especifically is becoming especially popularin the growing world of IT to fill "skill gaps" (WEF REF). You do some research in the "employer-free" model by AirBnB, where workers bring in their skills (or assets, in the airbnb case, their homes), they can set their own rates and time schedules. The "employer" only needs to set up the platform for the exchange of goods or services to happen and usually gets a fee out of each payment. You also find out about remote working and how it's creating a "repopulation of the rural areas", as people can work from anywhere as long as they have good Internet connections and the quite and peace of countryside can be very appealing.

Your see this tendency of computers, Artificial Intelligence and automatization...
