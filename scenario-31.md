# You hated companies right...?

The world has become a massive company and you are its leader. 

By expropiating all companies in the world, your original cooperative colleagues, in search of leadership (and mainly because they are scared of consequences at such a large scale) make you the head of this world/company/endeavor. As such, you run all operations in this new world. Your engineers tell you they have devised a way through Artificial Intelligence (AI) to increase productivity by 50%. 

They can have this new system up and running in about 6 months. "Unfortunately", a lot of your existing jobs are going to become obsolete. What do you do with your workers?

1. [I will speak with my Chief of Human Resources, maybe we can find ways to relocate them?](./scenario-7)
2. [Hm, I'm a leader now, but I was also a worker once. Even back then the long schedules we had seemed unproductive. Over the years I've devised a schedule decrease without changing the salary. I've always wanted to put it into practice...](./scenario-8)
3. [Wait, wait. What about the implications of using AI?](./scenario-9)
