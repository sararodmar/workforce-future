# A lot to think about!

Currently, humans perform 71% of task hours, compared to 29% by machines. Expected for 2022 is a shift of 58% by humans and 42% by machines. Even tasks that are predominantly human, such as coordinating, developing or advising, will begin to be automated by 2022 [20](https://sararodrig.github.io/workforce-future/references). 

That being said, reports support that technologies work best when they complement humans, instead of replacing them. There is also a growing recognition that AI tools, for example, require human oversight, by watching, training and improving algorithms [1](https://sararodrig.github.io/workforce-future/references).
